       timer or semaphore is created.  It is also called by various parts of the
       demo application.  If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the
       heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in
       FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used
       to query the size of free heap space that remains (although it does not
       provide information on how the remaining heap might be fragmented). */
