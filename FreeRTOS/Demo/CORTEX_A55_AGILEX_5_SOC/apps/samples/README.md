**Building the APPs**

The project uses cmake to setup the build<br>
This app adds Agilex5 FreeRTOS port as dependency<br>

In the samples directory(FreeRTOS/Demo/CORTEX_A55_AGILEX_5_SOC/apps/samples), execute the following commands
```bash
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
cd build
```
After the build completes, you will get 4 executables

* RTOSCliApp.elf
* RTOSEnetApp.elf
* RTOSBlinkyApp.elf
* RTOSFullApp.elf
