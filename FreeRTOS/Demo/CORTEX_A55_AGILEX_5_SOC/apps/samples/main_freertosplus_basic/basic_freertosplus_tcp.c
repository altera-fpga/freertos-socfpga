 *
 * Sample Application for FreeRTOS+TCP Server
 *
 * @details
 * @subsubsection description Description
 * This is a simple program that demonstrates how to create a TCP server using FreeRTOS+TCP.
 * The server waits for incoming TCP client connections on a specified port. Once a client
 * connects, it sends back a periodic message in the format:
 * `Message no.%d: Hello, This is FreeRTOS TCP server!`
 * 
 * Each message is sent with an incrementing count. This demonstrates socket handling,
 * connection acceptance, message formatting, and transmission over TCP using the FreeRTOS+TCP stack.
 *
 * @subsubsection prerequisites Prerequisites
 * - Ensure FreeRTOS+TCP is correctly configured and integrated with the network driver.
 * - Network PHY and MAC drivers must be initialized and functioning.
 * - A static IP or DHCP setup must be in place for the FreeRTOS+TCP stack.
 *
 * @subsubsection how_to_run How to Run
 * 1. Follow the platform-specific README to build and flash the application.
 * 2. Connect the device to a LAN where the host PC resides.
 * 3. Run a TCP client tool (e.g., `netcat` or `telnet`) from a host PC to connect to the server:
 *    - Example: `nc <board-ip> <port>`
 * 4. Once connected, observe the periodic server messages on the client terminal.
 *
 * @subsubsection expected_results Expected Results
 * - The TCP server starts listening on the configured port.
 * - Upon connection from a client, the server starts sending messages like:
 *   - `Message no.1: Hello, This is FreeRTOS TCP server!`
 *   - `Message no.2: Hello, This is FreeRTOS TCP server!`
 *   - ...
 * 
 * @subsubsection customization Customization
 * - Modify the `ulPort` variable to change the server port.
 * - Can be extended to support multiple concurrent client connections with minor enhancements.
