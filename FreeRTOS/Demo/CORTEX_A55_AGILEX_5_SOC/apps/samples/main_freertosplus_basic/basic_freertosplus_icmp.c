 * Sample Application for FreeRTOS+Ping Server
 *
 * @details
 * @subsubsection description Description
 * This is a simple program that demonstrates how to create a Ping server using FreeRTOS+ICMP.
 * The server waits for incoming ping client connections on a specified port. Once a client
 *
 * Each message is sent with an incrementing count. This demonstrates socket handling,
 * connection acceptance, message formatting, and transmission over TCP using the FreeRTOS+TCP stack.
 *
 * @subsubsection prerequisites Prerequisites
 * - Ensure FreeRTOS+TCP is correctly configured and integrated with the network driver.
 * - Network PHY and MAC drivers must be initialized and functioning.
 * - A static IP or DHCP setup must be in place for the FreeRTOS+TCP stack.
 *
 * @subsubsection how_to_run How to Run
 * 1. Follow the platform-specific README to build and flash the application.
 * 2. Connect the device to a LAN where the host PC resides.
 * 3. Run ping server.
 * 4. Once connected, observe the periodic server messages on the client terminal.
 *
 * @subsubsection expected_results Expected Results
 * - The ICMP server starts listening on the configured port.
 * - prints the recieved checksum.
